# SOAR: Semantic Multi-User MIMO Communications for Reliable Wireless Edge Computing 

Reliability (SOAR), a task-oriented multi-user MIMO framework for wireless edge computing executing vision tasks, e.g. object detection and image classification. SOAR pipeline uses distributional deep reinforcement learning (DDRL) agents with a multi-branched context-aware neural network.

This repository provides the full implementation and experimental setup to replicate the results presented in our paper:

The code includes:
- *DRL*: A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) environment tailored for MU-MIMO task offloading
- *System Packages & Experiments*: Scripts to run and log experimental evaluations
- *Experiments*: Configurations and setup instructions to reproduce all figures and metrics from the paper
- *Test Corruption*: Computer vision task corruption test
