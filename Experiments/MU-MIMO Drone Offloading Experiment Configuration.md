# MU-MIMO Drone Offloading Experiment Configuration:


## The metrics that we are going to measure: 
		(i) Latency				(Netcat)	
		(ii) Packet loss and 			(Netcat)
		(iii) Throughput 			(iperf3)





## Different Configurations to collect the data: 

(i) One AP One STA (The stations will always have one antenna and one spatial stream enabled)

		1. AP: One antenna One Spatial Stream 
				
				(***) BW: 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz

		2. AP: two antenna two Spatial Stream

				(***) BW: 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz

		3. AP: three antenna three Spatial Stream

				(***) BW: 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz

		4. AP: four antenna four Spatial Stream

				(***) BW: 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz


## Repeat the test (i) with following configurations: 

			** 	  One AP, two STA
			** 	  One AP, three STA
			***	  One AP, Four STA
			****  One AP, Five STA
