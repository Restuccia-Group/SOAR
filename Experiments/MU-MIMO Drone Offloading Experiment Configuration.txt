MU-MIMO Drone Offloading Experiment Configuration:

# The metrics that we are going to measure: 
		(i) Latency					(Netcat)	
		(ii) Packet loss and 		(Netcat)
		(iii) Throughput 			(iperf3)


Different Configurations to collect the data: 

(i) One AP One STA (The stations will always have one antenna and one spatial stream enabled)

		1. AP: One antenna One Spatial Stream 
		2. AP: two antenna two Spatial Stream
		3. AP: three antenna three Spatial Stream
		4. AP: four antenna four Spatial Stream

(ii) One AP two STA 
(iii) One AP three STA
